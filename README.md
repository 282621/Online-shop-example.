## Bootstrap-website-example
Bona Spe is a fictional association that deals with running social projects around the world. The goal of the website is to present the projects carried out by the association as well as to create a website that is a kind of showcase in the network.

## Motivation

This site was created to present skills related to CSS with the worldâ€™s most popular front-end component library - Bootstrap 4. The source code of the page has been overwritten and modified for the needs of the website. In the creation of this site I also used ready-made elements of page structure available on Mdbootstrap and Startbootstrap. 

## Goals

-understanding the operation of the library
-modification of ready elements created in the bootstrap
-individualization of library elements for the client's needs
-creating a website compatible with mobile first
-compliance with the RWD rules

## Build status
Finished.

## Code style
